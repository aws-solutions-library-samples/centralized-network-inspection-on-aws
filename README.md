## Prerequisites 

### Operating System 

Node.js version: 

**Node.js > 16**

### AWS account requirements

Supported Regions This guidance uses Network Firewall, which is not currently available in all AWS Regions. You must launch this guidance in
an AWS Region where AWS Network Firewall is available. For the most current availability of AWS services by Region, see the [AWS Regional
Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).

![](./media/image2.png)

## Deployment Steps

The high-level process Ô¨Çow for the guidance components deployed with the CloudFormation template is
as follows:

![](./assets/architecture.png)

1.  The CloudFormation template deploys an [inspection VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/deployment-models-for-aws-network-firewall/) with four subnets in randomly- selected Availability Zones in the Region where the guidance is deployed.

    a.  The guidance uses two of the subnets to create [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/)
        attachments for your VPCs if you provide an existing transit gateway ID.

    b.  The guidance uses the other two subnets to create [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/)
        endpoints in two randomly-selected Availability Zones in the Region where the guidance is deployed.


2.  The CloudFormation template creates a new [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) repository and a default network Ô¨Årewall conÔ¨Åguration that allows all traÔ¨Éc. This initiates [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) to run the following stages:


    a.  Validation stage -- The guidance validates the Network Firewall conÔ¨Åguration by using Network Firewall application programming
        interfaces (APIs) with dry run mode enabled. This allows the user to Ô¨Ånd unexpected issues before attempting an actual change. This stage
        also checks whether all the referenced Ô¨Åles in the conÔ¨Åguration exist in the JSON Ô¨Åle structure.

    b.  Deployment stage -- The guidance creates a new
        [Ô¨Årewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewalls.html),
        [Ô¨Årewall policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewall-policies.html),
        and [rule groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/rule-groups.html).
        If any of the resources already exist, the guidance updates these resources. This stage also helps with detecting any changes and
        remediates by applying the latest conÔ¨Åguration from the CodeCommit repository. The rule group changes roll back to the original state
        if one of the rule group changes fails. The appliance mode activates for the Transit Gateway to [Amazon VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)  attachment          to avoid asymmetric traÔ¨Éc. For more information, refer to [Appliance in a](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-appliance-scenario.html) [shared services VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-appliance-scenario.html).


3.  The guidance creates [Amazon VPC route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/RouteTables.html) for each Availability Zone. The default route destination target for each is the Amazon VPC endpoint for Network Firewall.

4.  The guidance creates a shared route table with Ô¨Årewall subnets. The default route destination target is the transit gateway ID. This
    route is only created if the transit gateway ID is provided in the CloudFormation input parameters.

Follow the steps for deploying your custom version of the guidance.

- Create an S3 bucket with the bucket appended with the region in which the deployment is to be made. example, if the deployment is to be made
  in us-east-1 create a bucket name as `\[BUCKET_NAME\]-us-east-1`.

- Create the distribution files using the script provided in the build section above.

- Create the S3 Key in the bucket `centralized-network-inspection/\[VERSION_ID\]/`

- Create the S3 Key in the bucket `centralized-network-inspection/latest/`

- Copy the file
  `./deployment/regional-s3-assets/centralized-network-inspection.zip` to
  the location
  `s3://\[BUCKET_NAME\]-\[REGION\]/centralized-network-inspection/\[VERSION_ID\]/`

- Copy the file
  `./deployment/regional-s3-assets/centralized-network-inspection-configuration.zip`
  to the location
  `s3://\[BUCKET_NAME\]-\[REGION\]/centralized-network-inspection/latest/`

Once the above steps are completed, use the file
`./deployment/global-s3-assets/centralized-network-inspection-on-aws.template` to create a stack in CloudFormation.

1.  Build the CDK code

```bash
cd source/
npm run build
```
2.  Build the Centralized Network Inspection guidance CodeBuild source code

```bash
cd source/centralizedNetworkInspection
tsc
```
3.  Build the templates for custom deployments

```bash
cd deployments/
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh \[SOLUTION_DIST_BUCKET\]
centralized-network-inspection \[VERSION_ID\]
```

## Deployment Validation

[]{#running-the-guidance-required .anchor}
Run the following commands to validate the deployment:
```bash
cd \<rootDir\>/deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

## Next Steps

Provide suggestions and recommendations about how customers can modify the parameters and the components of the Guidance to further enhance it
according to their requirements.

## Cleanup

Uninstall the guidance from the AWS Management Console or by using the [AWS
Command](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) [Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (AWS CLI).
Manually delete [several resources](#manually-uninstalling-resources) created by this guidance. This guidance doesn\'t automatically delete these resources in case you have stored data to retain.

### Using the AWS Management Console

1.  Sign in to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).

2.  On the **Stacks** page, select this guidance\'s installation stack.

3.  Choose **Delete**.

### Using AWS Command Line Interface

Determine whether the AWS CLI is available in your environment. For
installation instructions, see [What Is the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) in the *AWS CLI User Guide*. After conÔ¨Årming that the AWS CLI is available, run the following command.

### Manually uninstalling resources

The following resources will be retained even after the guidance is deleted. Refer to the following links to manually delete the resources:

- [AWS CodeCommit repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-delete-repository.html)

- [Amazon CloudWatch log groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Working-with-log-groups-and-streams.html)

## FAQ, known issues, additional considerations, and limitations

**Known issues**

### Problem: Missing Network Firewall resources

The CloudFormation stack has completed successfully, but not all the Network Firewall resources are created.

#### Resolution

After the CloudFormation stack is complete, the CodePipeline stage created by the guidance might still be in the In-Progress state. Once the CodePipeline stage is completed, all the Network Firewall resources will be available in the AWS Network Firewall console.

### Problem: Failed CodePipeline stage

The CodePipeline stage is failing.

#### Resolution

If the CodePipeline stage is in Failed state, it means that this guidance hasn\'t been able to complete the create or update network Ô¨Årewall resources operation. Refer to the logs in the CodePipeline stages to ensure that the CodeBuild stages are successful.

If a JSON Ô¨Åle is not valid or has incorrect information, the CodeBuild stage that validates the Ô¨Åles will list the errors along with the Ô¨Åle names.

For more information, refer to the [AWS CodeBuild User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
