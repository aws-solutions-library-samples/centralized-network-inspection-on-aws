# Solution Overview
Solution for Centralized Network Inspection on AWS.

<a name="architecture-diagram"></a>
# Architecture Diagram
![Architecture Diagram](./source/architecture.png)

<a name="prerequisites-for-customization"></a>
## Prerequisites for Customization
* Node.js>16

<a name="build"></a>
## Build
Build the CDK code
```
cd source/
npm run build
```

Build the Centralized Network Inspection Solution CodeBuild source code
```
cd source/centralizedNetworkInspection
tsc 
```

Build the templates for custom deployments

```
cd deployments/
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh [SOLUTION_DIST_BUCKET] centralized-network-inspection [VERSION_ID]
```

<a name="unit-test"></a>
## Unit Test
Run the unit tests 

```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

<a name="deploy"></a>
## Deploy
Follow the steps for deploying your custom version of the solution.
* Create an S3 bucket with the bucket appended with the region in which the deployment is to be made. example, if the deployment is to be made in us-east-1 create a bucket name as [BUCKET_NAME]-us-east-1.
* Create the distribution files using the script provided in the build section above.
* Create the S3 Key in the bucket centralized-network-inspection/[VERSION_ID]/
* Create the S3 Key in the bucket centralized-network-inspection/latest/
* Copy the file ./deployment/regional-s3-assets/centralized-network-inspection.zip to the location s3://[BUCKET_NAME]-[REGION]/centralized-network-inspection/[VERSION_ID]/
* Copy the file ./deployment/regional-s3-assets/centralized-network-inspection-configuration.zip to the location s3://[BUCKET_NAME]-[REGION]/centralized-network-inspection/latest/

Once the above steps are completed, use the file ./deployment/global-s3-assets/centralized-network-inspection-on-aws.template to create a stack in CloudFormation.
